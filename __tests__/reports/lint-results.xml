        message="Lint found an issue registry (`androidx.annotation.experimental.lint.ExperimentalIssueRegistry`) which did not specify the Lint API version it was compiled with.&#xA;&#xA;**This means that the lint checks are likely not compatible.**&#xA;&#xA;If you are the author of this lint check, make your lint `IssueRegistry` class contain&#xA;  override val api: Int = com.android.tools.lint.detector.api.CURRENT_API&#xA;or from Java,&#xA;  @Override public int getApi() { return com.android.tools.lint.detector.api.ApiKt.CURRENT_API; }&#xA;&#xA;If you are just using lint checks from a third party library you have no control over, you can disable these lint checks (if they misbehave) like this:&#xA;&#xA;    android {&#xA;        lintOptions {&#xA;            disable &quot;UnsafeExperimentalUsageError&quot;,&#xA;                    &quot;UnsafeExperimentalUsageWarning&quot;&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;"

        explanation="FragmentContainerView replaces the &lt;fragment> tag as the preferred                 way of adding fragments via XML. Unlike the &lt;fragment> tag, FragmentContainerView                 uses a normal `FragmentTransaction` under the hood to add the initial fragment,                 allowing further FragmentTransaction operations on the FragmentContainerView                 and providing a consistent timing for lifecycle events."

        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Gradle Dynamic Version"
        explanation="Using `+` in dependencies lets you automatically pick up the latest available version rather than a specific, named version. However, this is not recommended; your builds are not repeatable; you may have tested with a slightly different version than what the build server used. (Using a dynamic version as the major version number is more problematic than using it in the minor version position.)"

    <issue
        id="AllowBackup"
        severity="Warning"
        message="On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install. Consider adding the attribute `android:fullBackupContent` to specify an `@xml` resource which configures which files to backup. More info: https://developer.android.com/training/backup/autosyncapi.html"
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true` which means application data can be backed up and restored by the OS. Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts the application out of being backed up and so users can&apos;t restore data related to it when they go through the device setup wizard.&#xA;&#xA;Allowing backups may have security consequences for an application. Currently `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."

        summary="Unused resources"
        explanation="Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.&#xA;&#xA;The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a test source set instead.&#xA;&#xA;You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude them (usually for performance reasons), use lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true."

        summary="Image without `contentDescription`"
        explanation="Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the `contentDescription` attribute to specify a textual description of the widget such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately describe the user interface.&#xA;&#xA;Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do not provide any content or enable a user action should not have accessibility content descriptions. In this case, just suppress the lint warning with a tools:ignore=&quot;ContentDescription&quot; attribute.&#xA;&#xA;Note that for text fields, you should not set both the `hint` and the `contentDescription` attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set the `hint`. See https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps#special-cases"
